# Booking Creation Debug Guide

## Overview

This guide helps debug booking creation issues that occurred after converting from class-based to functional components.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Early Return in Checkout Component**

**Problem**: The checkout component had an early return that prevented proper rendering.
**Fix**: Moved the error boundary check after state initialization.

### 2. **Unreachable Code in Payment Processing**

**Problem**: There was unreachable code in the PhonePe payment flow.
**Fix**: Removed the early return that was blocking the fallback payment processing.

### 3. **Inconsistent State Management**

**Problem**: State updates weren't properly synchronized across the component.
**Fix**: Added proper loading state management and error handling.

### 4. **Missing Validation**

**Problem**: Insufficient validation of user data and prerequisites.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation using BookingDebugger.

## Debugging Tools Added

### 1. **BookingDebugger Utility**

- Tracks all booking-related operations
- Validates user session data
- Provides detailed logging
- Shows debug information via UI

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Better error messages
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading state management
- User-friendly alerts

### 3. **Debug Button**

- Added a debug button (bug icon) in the checkout screen
- Shows recent debug logs
- Helps identify issues in real-time

## How to Debug Booking Issues

### Step 1: Check User Session

```javascript
// Use BookingDebugger to validate user session
const validation = await BookingDebugger.validateBookingPrerequisites();
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.log('Session validation failed:', validation);
}
```

### Step 2: Monitor Payment Flow

```javascript
// Track payment steps
BookingDebugger.trackPayment('Starting payment', {amount: totalAmount});
BookingDebugger.trackPayment('Payment method selected', {
  method: paymentMethod,
});
```

### Step 3: Check API Calls

```javascript
// Monitor API responses
BookingDebugger.trackApiCall(
  '/api/ProductApi/sPayment',
  requestData,
  responseData,
  isSuccess,
);
```

### Step 4: View Debug Information

- Tap the bug icon in the checkout screen
- Check console logs for detailed information
- Use `BookingDebugger.showDebugInfo()` to see recent logs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "User not logged in" Error

**Cause**: UserProfileID missing from AsyncStorage
**Solution**:

- Check if user is properly logged in
- Verify AsyncStorage is working
- Re-login if necessary

### Issue 2: "Payment processing failed" Error

**Cause**: API call to payment endpoint failing
**Solution**:

- Check network connectivity
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Check request payload format

### Issue 3: "Cart validation failed" Error

**Cause**: Cart data is inconsistent
**Solution**:

- Clear cart and try again
- Check if products are still available
- Verify store information

### Issue 4: "Order not created" Error

**Cause**: Backend payment processing failed
**Solution**:

- Check backend logs
- Verify payment method is valid
- Ensure all required fields are present

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing

- [ ] User is logged in
- [ ] Cart has items
- [ ] User has a valid address
- [ ] Network connection is stable

### During Testing

- [ ] Monitor console logs
- [ ] Check debug information
- [ ] Verify each step completes
- [ ] Test both payment methods

### After Testing

- [ ] Verify order appears in Orders list
- [ ] Check order details are correct
- [ ] Confirm payment was processed
- [ ] Validate cart was cleared

## Debug Commands

### View Debug Logs

```javascript
BookingDebugger.showDebugInfo();
```

### Clear Debug Logs

```javascript
BookingDebugger.clearLogs();
```

### Export Debug Logs

```javascript
const logs = BookingDebugger.exportLogs();
console.log(logs);
```

### Validate Session

```javascript
const validation = await BookingDebugger.validateBookingPrerequisites();
console.log('Session validation:', validation);
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the debug logs using the bug icon
2. Look at console output for detailed errors
3. Verify all prerequisites are met
